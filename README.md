# Portable-ECG-Monitoring-System
This project is a real-time ECG signal visualizer and heart rate monitor built using the Processing environment. It receives analog ECG or pulse data from a portable hardware device (like an Arduino with a sensor), plots the waveform live, and calculates BPM (Beats Per Minute) using threshold-based peak detection.
